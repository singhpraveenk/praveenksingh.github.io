Presently, I am working at WRI India closely with urban local bodies (ULB) on the framing and implementation of sectoral air pollution strategies to curb air pollution inside the urban area.

I have done my Ph.D. from the <a href="https://iitr.ac.in/Centres/Centre%20of%20Excellence%20in%20Disaster%20Mitigation%20and%20Management/Home.html" target="_blank">Centre of Excellence in Disaster Mitigation & Management</a> (CoEDMM) at the <a href="https://iitr.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee</a> (IITR), India. 

My research centers on questions related to the Himalayan Cryosphere, Carbonous Aerosols, and Climate Change. I often use radiative transfer, radiation balance, and hydrological models in my research.
