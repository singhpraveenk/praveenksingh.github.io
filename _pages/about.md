I work at <a href="https://wri-india.org/" target="_blank">WRI India</a>, where I am closely engaged with urban local bodies (ULB) in framing and implementing sectoral air pollution strategies to curb air pollution inside the metropolitan area.

I have a Ph.D. from the <a href="https://iitr.ac.in/Centres/Centre%20of%20Excellence%20in%20Disaster%20Mitigation%20and%20Management/Home.html" target="_blank">Centre of Excellence in Disaster Mitigation & Management</a> (CoEDMM) at the <a href="https://iitr.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee</a> (IITR), India. 

My research centers on questions about the Himalayan Cryosphere, Carbonous Aerosols, and Climate Change. My research often uses radiative transfer, radiation balance, and hydrological models.
